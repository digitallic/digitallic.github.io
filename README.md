# digitallic.github.io
hey, free site, right?

digitallic.github.io is my portfolio site.

As a film student, I'm currently using Google Sites through my student account, and we know that's not gonna last forever.
I also didn't want to use any of the creation sites such as Wix or Squarespace.
PLus, I thought it would be more fun to pretend I could actually make my own site.
