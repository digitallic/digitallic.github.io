										<h2>Välkommen!</h2>

										<p>

											My name is <b>Adrian</b>, and on this page I'll be taking you on a small tour through my journey as a creative arts paraprofessional.
											<br><br>I was a <b>Bachelor of Film (Post Production)</b> student at SAE Institute Sydney due to graduate by December 2020.
										<hr />I'm a tech and entertainment enthusiast who likes to think about how your entertainment is made. I'm a 
										technologically adept youth of this new millenium, and I seek to make the world a more bearable place. 
										<br><br>
										I am also an aspiring motion designer and editor, and am currently refining my skills in both 
										Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects.
										<br><br>
										I’m adept at refreshing existing content for clients so you get more return on the investment you've made in your 
										videos for your business. Your videos may need a new, elegant look with graphics or a new edit with a little more 
										new content.
										<br><br>
										If you have your original footage, I can try my best to rework the project under your direction to post produce 
										videos that feel new, engaging, and do what they are supposed to do - promote your brand, attract new clients, 
										and be the audio-visual business card that will do you proud in the marketplace. 
										</p>

											<b>A Cup of Josie</b> (2020), directed by Hayden Huynh. 
											<br><br>A mini-documentary about Josephine "Josie" Casey, focusing on a "day in the life" of an apprentice chef, and the various
											themes of inclusivity and diversity within the hospitality industry.
											<br>On this production I worked as the Director of Photography, as well as the motion graphics animator, 
											focusing on the lower-thirds and the animated intro sequence. No templates were used.
											<br><br>A Cup of Josie is currently <a href=https://www.focusonability.com.au/FOA/films/2104.html>an open entrant </a>for the 
											Focus on Ability film festival.

											<b>Video Essay / Avant Garde Filmmaking</b> (2019), directed by Adrian Roas. 
											<br><br>In this video essay, my colleague Jack and I explore what avant-garde filmmaking is and how it affects the commercial
											standard method of filmmaking. I'll admit, it's a bit of a fluff piece, but it's one I certainly enjoyed creating. Skip to 2:55 for my part.
