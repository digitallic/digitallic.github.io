										<h2>Välkommen!</h2>
										<p>My name is <b>Adrian</b>, and on this page I'll be taking you on a small tour through my journey as a creative arts paraprofessional.
										<br>I am a <b>Bachelor of Film (Post Production)</b> student due to graduate by December 2020.
										<hr />I'm a technology and entertainment enthusiast. I enjoy entertainment (don't we all?) 
										and I like to think about how entertainment is made. I'm a technologically adept youth of this new millenium, and 
										I seek to make the world a more bearable place. I am also an aspiring motion designer and editor, and am currently 
										refining my skills in both Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects.
										<br><br>I started studying at SAE because I thought it was the perfect place for someone of my calibre to recieve a 
										training regimen effective enough to see a career in this path. Film has always been a subtle passion of mine, 
										and with the skills that SAE has equipped me with, I'm grateful to say that I chose the right path. 
										<br><br>My hobbies include building mechanical keyboards, lauding over well-shot films, and playing at amateur levels of competitive <s>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</s> Valorant.
										<hr />I’m an enthusiastic individual who is eager to embrace new and diverse challenges to advance my working career. I am a quick learner who is determined to develop my abilities while adding maximum value to my organisation. 
										<br><br>I take pride in my work, where I would devote time and effort into achieving the best possible results, including being a team player for my colleagues through communications skills and trust building. 
										<br><br><b><a href="neueResume200708.pdf">Here's</a></b> my resume.
										</p>
										<blockquote>I am not going to give up before I win a motherfucking major. - <a href="https://twitter.com/ZeusCSGO/status/751486536001187840">Danylo "Zeus" Teslenko</a> (1 year and 14 days before he <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/21121/gambit-overcome-astralis-to-major-final">won a $1,000,000 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive major tournament)</a></blockquote>

											<b>A Cup of Josie</b> (2019), directed by Hayden Huynh. 
											<br><br>This is a documentary about Josephine "Josie" Casey, focusing on a "day in the life" of an apprentice chef, and the various
											themes of inclusivity and diversity within the hospitality industry.
											<br>On this production I worked as the Director of Photography, as well as the lead (and only) motion graphics animator, primarily
											focusing on the lower-thirds and the animated intro sequence. No templates were used.

											<b>Video Essay / Avant Garde Filmmaking</b> (2019), directed by Adrian Roas. 
											<br><br>In this video essay, my colleague Jack and I explore what avant-garde filmmaking is and how it affects the commercial
											standard method of filmmaking. I'll admit, it's a bit of a fluff piece, but it's one I certainly enjoyed creating. Skip to 3:30 for my part.
